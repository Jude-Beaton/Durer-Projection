# Durer Projection in C with custom matrix and vector maths libraries
## Aims of the project:
I want to understand how game graphics are created from scratch, this project is the very beginning of representing 3d graphics the end goal is to be able to represent 3d objects on a 2d screen in C using SDL. I hope to extend this project to the point of making my own game engine entirely in C capable of rendering 3d graphics.

## Inspiration:
I learned about this projection method from the book *Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice, Third Edition*

## Current Progress:
- Simple matrix and vector maths libraries made in C for use in the main program
- A compileable main.c that will display and rotate a 3d wireframe cube
- A python program with similar functionality

## Next Steps:
- Add more default shapes
- Keyboard controlled movement
- save shapes to a custom filetype to be loaded in
- simulate camera movement by moving the shape around the camera
- I might start a game engine in a seperate repo that uses similar techniques to this
